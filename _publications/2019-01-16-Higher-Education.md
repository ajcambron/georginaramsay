excerpt: 'Empirical interest in exploring the settlement experiences of people from refugee backgrounds has long been an area of research interest and advocacy. In particular, there has been significant growth in research that focuses on students from refugee backgrounds as they navigate the education systems of these settlement contexts, with a particular focus on refugee children and youth in schooling contexts. Less is known about the experiences of students from refugee backgrounds in higher education. This article speaks to this gap in our collective knowledge, offering a meta-scoping study of 46 papers on students from refugee backgrounds in international higher education contexts. '
